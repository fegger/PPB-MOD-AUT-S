# PPB-MOD-AUT-S

This repository collects models and equations to calculate the autotrophic sulfide removal by purple phototrophic bacteria (PPB).
Models are written in python: One model for batch processes (PAnM-S.py), and another model for continuous processes (PAnM-continuous-S.py). 
The batch model (PAnM-S.py) is part of the publication: 

F. Egger, T. Hulsen, S. Tait, D. J. Batstone,
Autotrophic sulfide removal by mixed culture purple phototrophic bacteria,
Water Research 182 (2020) 115896. doi:10.1016/j.watres.2020.115896.

The continuous model is part of a publication in preparation:

F. Egger, T. Hulsen, D. J. Batstone,
Continuous H2S removal from biogas using purple phototrophic bacteria,
in preparation to be submitted to Water Research
